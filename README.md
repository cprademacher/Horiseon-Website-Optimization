Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I was tasked with improving the accessibility of Horiseon's website.
- Why did you build this project? To improve the SEO quality and semantic structure of the website and its code.
- What problem does it solve? I made the code easier to read, understand, and increased the quality of the site's SEO.
- What did you learn? I learned how to condense CSS rules to make the code easier to read and undestand.  This can take a lot of thorough searching and problem solving.
